While working as an AI Data Annotator & Reasoning Specialist at Outlier AI, I spearheaded the development of structured tasks designed to train large language models (LLMs). This experience honed my skills in creating precise, competency-based assessments \u2014 a key responsibility in this role at Mindrift.\n\nIn particular, my work on the wildfire detection system and the AI personal image generation app demonstrates my ability to design detailed, high-level skills taxonomies. For the wildfire detection project, I developed end-to-end machine learning models that analyzed environmental data with an impressive 86% detection accuracy. Similarly, the image generation app project involved designing full-stack solutions and custom fine-tuning pipelines, showcasing my proficiency in both technical implementation and framework creation \u2014 essential qualities for developing effective qualification tests.\n\nMoreover, my role in leading the LinkedIn job application automator project further emphasizes my ability to provide strategic guidance and implement continuous improvement processes.
