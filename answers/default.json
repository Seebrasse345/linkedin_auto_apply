  "Cover letter": "Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am excited to apply for the Financial Controller position at BOW. My extensive experience in high-growth environments, in-depth knowledge of financial management, and proven track record in strategic financial planning align well with the requirements of this role. \n\nWith over three years of experience as an AI Data Annotator & Reasoning Specialist, I have honed my skills in problem-solving, strategic planning, and data analysis. My work at Outlier AI has equipped me with the ability to manage complex projects and devise strategic solutions, skills that I believe are crucial for the Financial Controller position. Leading data annotation and synthetic task creation projects, I have developed a keen eye for detail and an aptitude for driving efficiency, which are essential for managing financial reporting, compliance, and multi-entity accounting.\n\nOne of my significant achievements was developing an IoT-based wildfire detection system during my time at the University of Sheffield. This project required meticulous financial planning, resource allocation, and risk management \u2013 all integral components of the Financial Controller role. Additionally, my experience in creating a LinkedIn Job Application Automator demonstrates my ability to oversee multi-phase projects from conception to execution, emphasizing my strong financial strategy and reporting skills.\n\nMy enthusiasm for BOW's mission to transform robotics aligns with my passion for technological innovation. The prospect of contributing to your growth by leveraging my financial expertise is highly motivating. I bring a proactive mindset, keen analytical skills, and a strategic approach to financial management that I am confident will be beneficial to your team.\n\nThe opportunity to shape financial strategy at a pioneering VC-backed start-up is particularly appealing to me. As someone who thrives in dynamic environments and has a comprehensive understanding of financial regulations across multiple entities, I am well-prepared to manage compliance, support fundraising initiatives, and oversee cash flow and financial risks effectively.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to BOW and am eager to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications align with the needs of your innovative team.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMatthaios Markatis\nmatthaiosmarkatis@gmail.com\n07480 699246\nLinkedIn: matthaios-markatis\nGitHub: Seebrasse345",
