  "Cover letter": "Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am excited to apply for the IT Service Desk Operator position at Logisnext UK Ltd. With over three years of experience in service desk roles, coupled with a solid technical background and a passion for delivering exceptional IT support, I am eager to contribute to your esteemed organization.\n\nIn my previous role as an AI Data Annotator & Reasoning Specialist at Outlier AI, I honed my skills in troubleshooting, technical analysis, and providing first-line support. My experience with Windows 10/11, Microsoft 365, and IT ticketing systems aligns closely with the core responsibilities outlined in your job listing. I also possess a robust understanding of IP, DNS, DHCP, and subnetting principles, which enables me to swiftly diagnose and resolve technical issues.\n\nA notable achievement in my career is the development of a real-time wildfire detection system during a research project at the University of Sheffield. This project required meticulous data analysis, effective use of machine learning models, and a collaborative approach to integrating IoT sensors and real-time mapping. The result was an 86% accuracy rate in fire detection, demonstrating my problem-solving capabilities and technical expertise.\n\nFurthermore, I developed and deployed an AI Personal Image Generation App using a full-stack solution in Flutter, Firebase, and OAuth, which showcases my proficiency in both software development and user support. This application was successfully published with a growing user base, reflecting my commitment to delivering high-quality, user-centered solutions.\n\nAt Logisnext UK Ltd, I am thrilled about the opportunity to support colleagues across the UK and Europe, contributing to the innovative logistics solutions you provide. My proactive problem-solving mindset, excellent communication skills, and dedication to high standards of customer service will enable me to thrive in this role and drive the success of your IT team.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and projects align with the goals of Logisnext UK Ltd.\n\nSincerely,\nMatthaios Markatis\nmatthaiosmarkatis@gmail.com\n07480 699246",

  "What interests you about engineering, and why do you think you'd be good at an engineering apprenticeship?": "I have always been fascinated by the way engineering shapes the world around us, from the everyday products we rely on to the large-scale systems that power entire industries. My background in physics has provided me with a strong analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of how systems work, which naturally draws me to engineering, particularly in areas of electrical control and automation. I am especially interested in this apprenticeship at Marshalls because it offers a unique combination of hands-on experience and structured learning, allowing me to apply concepts from my academic studies to real-world engineering challenges.\n\nThrough my degree and various technical projects, I have developed practical skills in programming, electronics, and data-driven system design, including building IoT-based sensor systems and deploying automation solutions. These experiences have given me a keen appreciation for reliable, innovative engineering and the value of teamwork in achieving set goals. I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers at Marshalls and to contribute to the company\u2019s commitment to best-in-class technical solutions and continuous improvement.\n\nI believe I would excel in this apprenticeship due to my strong work ethic, eagerness to learn, and ability to collaborate effectively in team environments. I am motivated by new challenges and am willing to take on the responsibilities of national travel and site work, as outlined in the role. I am confident that this apprenticeship will enable me to gain the specialist knowledge and hands-on skills needed to become a highly capable Electrical Control & Automation Engineer, and I look forward to developing my career with Marshalls.",
