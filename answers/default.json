These experiences have given me a keen appreciation for reliable, innovative engineering and the value of teamwork in achieving set goals. I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers at Marshalls and to contribute to the company\u2019s commitment to best-in-class technical solutions and continuous improvement.\n\nI believe I would excel in this apprenticeship due to my strong work ethic, eagerness to learn, and ability to collaborate effectively in team environments. I am motivated by new challenges and am willing to take on the responsibilities of national travel and site work, as outlined in the role. I am confident that this apprenticeship will enable me to gain the specialist knowledge and hands-on skills needed to become a highly capable Electrical Control & Automation Engineer, and I look forward to developing my career with Marshalls.",

  "Do you have a Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field. Tell us more.": "Yes, I hold a BSc in Physics from the University of Sheffield, which is directly relevant to the fields of data science and artificial intelligence due to its emphasis on computational methods, advanced programming, and statistical analysis. Through my degree, I undertook modules in advanced Python programming, physical computing, and AI-driven research, and I further solidified my expertise by completing both the IBM Data Science and IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificates. These provided deep, hands-on experience in machine learning, model deployment, and end-to-end AI system design. My background has prepared me extensively to contribute to high-impact AI engineering teams like Vable\u2019s, and I am eager to leverage my academic and technical foundation to help deliver innovative AI solutions for your clients.",
  "Tell us how you have a minimum of 3 years experience of polyglot software engineering (full stack with a focus on Java) and how you have a desire to develop and grow.": "While my professional full-time experience does not yet total three years, I have a robust and diverse foundation in polyglot software engineering, end-to-end development, and AI application deployment. My BSc in Physics from the University of Sheffield included advanced programming modules in Python and foundational studies in computer science principles, complemented by self-directed projects and industry-recognized IBM certifications in Data Science and AI Engineering. \n\nThroughout the past two years, I have successfully engineered full-stack solutions integrating Python, JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Node.js), and SQL/NoSQL databases for production projects\u2014including a wildfire IoT detection system, an AI-driven image app, and automation/integration across cloud services (AWS, GCP). While my Java experience is less extensive than my Python and JavaScript work, I have written clean, testable code in Java during university and side projects, and I am highly motivated to develop further in this direction. My approach is always to pick up new languages and frameworks as required to deliver innovative results\u2014evidenced by my rapid adoption of technologies such as Flutter/Dart, Docker, and modern ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch). \n\nI thrive in dynamic, multidisciplinary environments and have demonstrated leadership and team collaboration as a Team Leader at Meltdown-Wetherspoons and in academic research teams. My desire to grow is demonstrated by continuous self-improvement, ongoing certification, and seeking projects pushing my boundaries\u2014such as fine-tuning LLMs, building intelligent web automators, and cloud-native ML deployment. I am eager to deepen my full stack and Java expertise within Vable\u2019s engineering-driven and values-led culture, contributing innovative AI features and scaling my impact within your team.",
  "Tell us a little more about your Python programming skills. In particular what are main differences you\u2019ve found between coding in Python and Java for AI/ML tasks? When would you choose one over the other?": "My Python programming experience spans a range of AI/ML projects, including developing end-to-end pipelines, deploying models, and delivering production-ready solutions such as an IoT-based wildfire detection system and an AI image generation app. Python\u2019s major strengths for AI/ML are its rich ecosystem (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy), concise syntax, and rapid prototyping capabilities, making it my go-to for research, development, and applied data science. Compared to Java, Python streamlines experimentation with cleaner syntax, dynamic typing, and access to cutting-edge libraries, which greatly accelerates iteration in ML workflows.\n\nOn the other hand, Java offers advantages in building large-scale, high-performance systems: its static typing, compilation, and mature concurrency support make it preferable for robust, enterprise-grade applications where efficiency and maintainability are priorities. I\u2019d typically opt for Java when integrating AI models into complex backend architectures or where type safety and speed are critical, such as in real-time financial platforms or large SaaS backend services.\n\nIn summary, I choose Python for rapid AI development, prototyping, and model training, especially when leveraging the rich Python ML ecosystem. For deploying models into scalable, production environments with strict performance or integration requirements, Java\u2019s strengths become valuable. With both languages, I write clean, modular code and collaborate effectively across engineering teams to deliver reliable AI solutions.",
  "You\u2019re asked to design a model that recommends company Slack channels for new joiners based on their interests. Walk us through your approach.": "To design a model recommending company Slack channels for new joiners based on their interests, I would begin with a data-driven, user-centric approach:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data such as new joiners\u2019 profile information (role, department, skills, interests), public Slack channel metadata (topics, activity levels, keywords), and historical join data indicating which types of employees joined which channels.\n\n2. **Interest Extraction (NLP)**: Utilize NLP techniques (spaCy, NLTK, or transformer-based models) to extract and normalize interests from user input, onboarding questionnaires, or HR profiles. Similarly, process the Slack channel descriptions and historical posts to build descriptive embeddings for each channel.\n\n3. **User & Channel Representation**: Represent both users and channels as feature vectors. For users, vectors could capture explicit interests, inferred interests (from role, past experience), and department info. For channels, text embeddings of topics, activity scores, and participant demographics.\n\n4. **Recommendation Algorithm**: Implement a hybrid model:\n   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Match user interest vectors to channel embeddings using cosine similarity or nearest neighbor search.\n   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage historic data\u2014e.g., new joiners with similar profiles joined certain channels\u2014in a matrix factorization or graph-based recommendation setup.\n   - Optionally, use or fine-tune transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for improved semantic matchmaking between user interests and channel content.\n\n5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train on historical join data, optimizing for metrics such as precision, recall, and user engagement post-recommendation. Use validation sets and A/B testing to ensure quality and avoid overfitting.\n\n6. **Explainability & Iteration**: Ensure recommendations come with short explanations (e.g., \u201cYou\u2019re recommended #ml-research because you indicated an interest in AI\u201d) for transparency. Gather feedback from users to iteratively refine feature engineering, model input, and output relevance.\n\n7. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Deploy the model as a service integrated with onboarding workflows and Slack\u2019s API, monitor uptake, and use analytics to continuously improve recommendations.\n\nThis approach draws on my experience deploying end-to-end ML pipelines, NLP-driven systems, and recommender models (as in my AI image generation app and LLM-based automation projects). With a focus on explainability, robust evaluation, and user-driven iteration, this solution would ensure new joiners integrate quickly and meaningfully into company culture.",
  "You\u2019ve trained an NLP model using spaCy, but the performance on named entity recognition (NER) is poor. What steps would you take to troubleshoot and improve it?": "When troubleshooting poor named entity recognition (NER) performance with a spaCy model, I would follow a systematic approach to identify and address the root causes. First, I would analyze the dataset quality, ensuring that training data is accurately annotated and sufficiently representative of the entities and contexts relevant to the task. I would check for label inconsistencies or imbalance\u2014since uneven distribution or annotation errors can severely impact model learning\u2014using manual inspection and evaluation metrics.\n\nNext, I would experiment with data augmentation if data is sparse, and consider collecting further annotated samples. I would also evaluate if the default spaCy model or pipeline is appropriate for the domain, and consider leveraging transfer learning by starting from a larger pre-trained model or fine-tuning with domain-specific texts.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019d review hyperparameters such as learning rates and batch sizes, and run experiments adjusting model architecture or adding custom components like entity rulers for specific patterns. To monitor progress, I would utilize evaluation tools\u2014precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices and qualitative error analysis\u2014to identify systematic weaknesses or entity types that aren\u2019t being recognized.\n\nTo further improve generalization, I might apply techniques such as cross-validation or introduce regularization to avoid overfitting. I would collaborate with teammates to conduct code and data reviews for additional insights. Documentation and iterative testing would guide the process until the desired performance is achieved. This thorough and collaborative process reflects my hands-on experience with modern NLP pipelines, model evaluation, and data-centric model improvement, as described in your requirements and as practiced in my previous AI engineering and data science projects.",
  "From your experience how does gradient descent work? Can you explain it in terms a non technical stakeholder would understand?": "Gradient descent is a method used by AI models to \"learn\" by gradually improving their performance. Imagine you are at the top of a hill and want to reach the lowest point in a valley. However, it\u2019s very foggy, so you can't see the whole landscape. Instead, you rely on feeling which direction slopes downwards at each step, and you take a small step in that direction. By repeating this process, you steadily get closer to the lowest point. \n\nSimilarly, in training AI models, gradient descent helps the system make small adjustments to its parameters (the \"steps\") based on how well it\u2019s doing, so that it minimizes errors and gets better over time. This is a step-by-step optimization approach that allows models to become more accurate by learning from their mistakes and correcting them with each iteration.",

With a background in Physics, hands-on experience in building scalable ETL pipelines, data-driven applications, and a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and AWS, I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to your cross-functional engineering team.\n\nI am particularly drawn to the collaborative and impact-driven culture at Runna, where engineers play a foundational role in both technology decisions and product direction. The prospect of developing robust data infrastructure, supporting advanced analytics, and delivering actionable insights for a fast-scaling product is both motivating and a great fit for my technical strengths. I am eager to work alongside innovators who value knowledge sharing, continuous improvement, and agile development, and I look forward to helping Runna achieve its vision of becoming the go-to platform for millions of runners worldwide.",
  "What's your favourite problem you've solved, and why does it stand out for you?": "One of my favourite problems I have solved was the development of a real-time wildfire detection system as part of my research at the University of Sheffield. The challenge involved designing and implementing a robust end-to-end data pipeline that could process and analyze environmental data from distributed IoT sensors using machine learning algorithms. What made this problem stand out was the need to not only achieve high prediction accuracy and early warning capabilities but also create a scalable and efficient system that could operate in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios.\n\nI tackled the project by combining quantitative methods with ETL pipeline development in Python, training Random Forest and Decision Tree models on NASA FIRMS data. I then built a responsive dashboard using Flask and Leaflet.js to visualize alerts and enable interactive monitoring. The solution demonstrated an 86% detection accuracy and provided alerts up to 10 minutes before traditional methods.\n\nThis project stands out to me because it required collaboration across software engineering, data science, and product development disciplines\u2014mirroring the cross-functional teamwork Runna values. I enjoyed thoughtfully architecting the system to prioritize data quality, scalability, and actionable insight, all of which align closely with the requirements of this Data Engineer role. The impact of delivering a solution that can meaningfully reduce disaster response times highlighted for me the value of building data-driven platforms with real-world significance\u2014something I am excited to bring to Runna as you continue to scale data-powered coaching and user experience.",

In my field, I am especially excited to see AI tackle complex challenges in automation, creative content generation, and intelligent data analysis. The prospect of empowering teams with AI-driven tools that can streamline processes, deliver actionable insights, and unlock new avenues for creativity aligns strongly with my own experience in developing end-to-end AI applications, such as IoT-based detection systems and generative AI apps. I am eager to help Storm Ideas remain at the forefront of innovation by exploring how the latest advances in AI, particularly in automation and large language models, can be harnessed to enhance internal and client-facing operations, making work smarter, faster, and more impactful.",
  "Tell us about a time AI boosted your productivity or solved a problem. Work or personal examples welcome!": "One significant example of AI boosting my productivity was during the development of my LinkedIn Job Application Automator project. As someone actively seeking new roles, I noticed that manually applying to hundreds of job postings was time-consuming and inefficient. Leveraging Python and Playwright, I engineered an intelligent automation system that could handle the entire LinkedIn job application process. By integrating OpenAI\u2019s API, the system was able to dynamically generate tailored cover letters and intelligently detect form fields, drastically accelerating the process and ensuring applications were personalised and error-free.\n\nThis end-to-end automation allowed me to submit over 400 targeted job applications daily, transforming a process that would have taken several hours into one that took minutes. In addition to significantly streamlining my job search, this project improved my workflow by reducing repetitive manual input, freeing up valuable time for learning and professional development. The experience gave me deeper insights into real-world AI implementation, from prompt engineering to robust workflow automation, and reinforced my passion for integrating AI-driven approaches to solve process inefficiencies\u2014an outlook I\u2019m excited to bring to the AI Automation Coordinator role at Storm Ideas.",
