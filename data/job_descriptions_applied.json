Based on safe light alone, our goal is to equip clinicians with advanced computer-assisted tissue analysis for improved surgical precision and patient safety. \n\n \n\nWe have developed a computational Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) system for improved intraoperative surgical guidance. HSI is a safe optical imaging modality perfectly suited for the clinic. By splitting light into multiple wavelengths far beyond what the naked eye can see, HSI carries diagnostic information about tissue properties ideal for objective tissue characterisation. This will objectively enhance the surgeon\u2019s ability to visualise and characterise tissue intraoperatively without injecting any toxic contrast agents. In addition, our system can monitor vital physiological tissue properties, thereby increasing surgical precision and patient safety while optimising resection. \n\nFollowing successful in-patient clinical studies and development of a commercial medical device, we are excited to now place our patented technology into the hands of surgeons. \n\n \n\nWe are building our company at the intersection of surgery, machine learning and interventional image computing for optical systems to increase surgical precision and patient safety. We are backed by a highly experienced syndicate of European and American HealthTech investors, including the corporate venture arm of ZEISS, a multinational technology leader.

Developing a data driven value chain is a strategic pillar for AlbionVC.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Albion\n\nWhen AlbionVC was founded in 1996 the fund set out to partner with visionary entrepreneurs to create successful companies across a range of industries. A lot has changed since; however the way we do business has not. We are supportive investors who strive for excellence and act with integrity and humility in our interactions with founders and with each other. We invest in startups with potential to grow into enduring companies that reshape industries. In doing so we achieve top quartile returns for our investors.\n\n\n\n\nToday we focus on the software, healthcare and deeptech sectors in the UK with \u00a31 billion of capital. The knowledge and insights we have built up over the last 29 years have given us an ability to spot companies that are set to become global category leaders, and as a result we have multiple successful exits and unicorns in our portfolio.\n\nAll of this is only possible because of the long term, considerate yet high performing culture, embodied by an inspiring team, half of whom have been doing this for well over a decade.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are seeking a Data Engineer to help spearhead a new data-driven era for AlbionVC\u2019s investment process, with digitisation, automation, and data-driven decision at its core. Our data tools will deliver outsized returns through greater efficiency and effectiveness across the investment value chain: i) discovering investment opportunities, ii) evaluating, selecting and converting these opportunities, and iii) driving portfolio company growth. We support utilising the best third party or proprietary tools and data services in pursuit of this ambition.\n\n\n\n\nYou will have a high degree of autonomy but be supported by a dynamic and driven team comprising partners and investment team members.

You will also be comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with high degrees of autonomy. A working knowledge of the venture capital space is a plus, but this is a developer role and hence you are fundamentally an engineer/data scientist at heart.

    "description": "About the job\n\nHelp us use technology to make a big green dent in the universe!\n\nKraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.\n\nWe\u2019re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.\n\nKraken Customer\n\nWhat we do: build the most AI-driven, innovative, forward-thinking platform for energy management. From optimising resources to delivering cost-effective, exceptional customer experiences through advanced Customer Information Systems (CIS), billing, meter data management, CRM, and AI-driven communications, Kraken is powering the next wave of innovation in the energy industry.\n\nWhy we do it: future energy will not look like energy as we know it today. We need to not just think about our future, but build for it. Now.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\n\nWe have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK utilities market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.\nWe have challenging technical problems to solve; like processing tens of millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption. Or thinking about how we adapt Kraken to improve other utilities like water and broadband.\nThere's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.\nYou'll be working for a company that\u2019s fighting climate change. Our generation arm is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and is funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.\n\n\nWhat You'll Need\n\n\nWe're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):\nPython\nDjango (or equiv. web framework)\nDomain modelling\nHTTP and REST APIs\nWriting robust and fault-tolerant software\nCelery and async processing\nPostgres\n\n\nPlus Experience In The Following Would Be a Bonus\n\n\nAWS\nTerraform, Packer, Consul\n\n\nWhy else you'll love it here\n\n\nWondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Kraken - what's more important to us is finding the right Kraken-fit!\nKraken has an unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! Our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people \nVisit our perks hub - Kraken Employee Benefits \n\n\nIf this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.\n\nAre you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!\n\nStudies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.",

They\u2019re offering the opportunity to work with a really modern tech stack, where you will be building really scalable greenfield solutions in a really fun and flexible work environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ve got a really busy pipeline of projects, really strong relationships with their long list of clients which spirals across multiple sectors (Fintech, Renewables, Oil & Gas, Public + many more!). It\u2019s a really unique environment where Engineers can have a lot of choice in what projects they want to join and tech they want to work with \u2013 this is highlighted with the tenure of many of their team, as many have been with the business for 5-10 years (it\u2019s really uncommon for someone to have a short-stint here!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresently, they\u2019ve got a couple requirements to join one of their Agile squads where you\u2019ll be working on a core project for one of their key clients using Java and Angular \u2013 so are ideally looking for Engineers that feel comfortable with these technologies. However, generally the organisation are pretty tech agnostic and it\u2019s a great environment for learning different technologies. They also using Python, .Net, TypeScript and are big users of Cloud Services (both AWS and Azure) \u2013 so there is plenty of technologies to learn here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be joining a squad of circa 4-6 Engineers (depending on the project) and usually you\u2019ll be with the project from its initial design straight through to its completion \u2013 so you\u2019ll really pick up good exposure to working on large-scale projects. The teams are also really well defined as each will usually have a Project Lead, Software Architect, Front-End, Back-End or Full Stack Engineers, UX Specialists, Automation Engineers and DevOps Engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat separates them from other consultancies is you\u2019ll never be offshored to their client, you\u2019ll work within the business at all times (either onsite or at home). They also have a pretty strict no-overtime policy, as they\u2019re massive on finding the right work-to-life balance \u2013 so fortunately no really tight-deadlines or working late into the night. On top of this, they offer really flexible working \u2013 they\u2019re a family first organisation so the school drop off / pick up or even mid-day nursery appointments are all fine here. Not to mention, the company run multiple events from guest speakers to even weekly lunch treats for the team!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir office is based in central Newcastle, where it\u2019s really accessible by public transport links. They ideally hope people can pop into the offices once a week for SPRINTS / Meetings / Tech events etc but are pretty flex with this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey offer a competitive salary for this role (more than happy to discuss figures before submitting an application). This is on-top of a fairly competitive benefits package which includes an annual training allowance, good pension, loyal rewarding holiday scheme + many more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you match most of the criteria, please do apply or feel free to reach out to Molly Candlish at Cathcart Technology to find out more.",
