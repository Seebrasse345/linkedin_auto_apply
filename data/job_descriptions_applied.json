Based on safe light alone, our goal is to equip clinicians with advanced computer-assisted tissue analysis for improved surgical precision and patient safety. \n\n \n\nWe have developed a computational Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) system for improved intraoperative surgical guidance. HSI is a safe optical imaging modality perfectly suited for the clinic. By splitting light into multiple wavelengths far beyond what the naked eye can see, HSI carries diagnostic information about tissue properties ideal for objective tissue characterisation. This will objectively enhance the surgeon\u2019s ability to visualise and characterise tissue intraoperatively without injecting any toxic contrast agents. In addition, our system can monitor vital physiological tissue properties, thereby increasing surgical precision and patient safety while optimising resection. \n\nFollowing successful in-patient clinical studies and development of a commercial medical device, we are excited to now place our patented technology into the hands of surgeons. \n\n \n\nWe are building our company at the intersection of surgery, machine learning and interventional image computing for optical systems to increase surgical precision and patient safety. We are backed by a highly experienced syndicate of European and American HealthTech investors, including the corporate venture arm of ZEISS, a multinational technology leader. In addition, we are supported by the British Royal Academy of Engineering, Innovate UK, NIHR (National Institute for Health Research), the Creative Destruction Lab, and King\u2019s Health Partners MedTech Innovations to improve surgical care. \n\n \n\nJoin us and help shape our growth toward Series A and beyond. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we offer \n\nRecognising and rewarding talent: A competitive salary of \u00a354,000 to \u00a385,000 \nEquity: Participate in our share options scheme \nTax-efficient earnings: Cycle to Work Scheme and Workplace Nursery Benefits \nDays to recharge: 25 days of annual leave + bank holidays \nWorkday fuel: Complimentary snacks and drinks in the office \nTeam culture: An inclusive monthly social to connect with colleagues \nThoughtful hybrid working approach: Tailored working arrangements agreed with your manager \nWellbeing coverage: An Employee Assistance Programme for 24/7 counselling, financial and legal support \nPersonalise your workspace: A yearly \u00a3150 tech stipend for office essentials and productivity boosters \nState-of-the-art research environment: Key access to crucial resources for R&D and product development for surgery, including hospitals, a mock operating room, lab spaces, and computational facilities, with offices located in the vibrant\u202fLondon Institute for Healthcare Engineering. \nReal-world impact: Participate in an investigational clinical study involving 40 patients at 3 UK centres for laparoscopic abdominal surgery which commenced in Q1 2025 \n\n\n\n\nAt Hypervision Surgical, we are committed to promoting equal opportunities in employment and creating a workplace culture in which diversity and inclusion is valued and everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
